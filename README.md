# SeedlingEducation

Democratizing education is the foremost goal of society.
But, democratic education also means democratizing teaching.
The Seedling Project utilizes the wisdom and knowledge gathered
by the masses (students) to create a library of high-quality
resources for future generations of students to benefit from.
We enrich our knowledge by democratizing teaching not only
because the resources created through the process are high-quality
and equitable, but also because the process itself (of teaching and
creation) develops the character of each who partakes in its fruit.

Each person with their own unique and diverse background, especially in
community colleges can contribute their experiences in education,
life, research, and more with other students. Who is more qualified
to answer unusually specific questions about education than those
who are actively navigating its challenges?

Democratize education, improve academic outcomes, and pave the way for
our future scientists and engineers.

## Github Contributions

At this moment, there are two branches: main and frontend.
Clone the repository.
Set the main to your upstream as such:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main <variable_name>.
the <variable_name> can be found with the git branch
command.

### Setting Upstream:

Setting an upstream branch establishes a link between your
current branch and a specified remote branch.
This is useful when you want to track changes from a
specific remote branch in your current branch
The upstream setting merely establishes a default remote branch
that your local branch will interact with when you run commands
like git pull or git merge.

### Pulling:

git pull: is a command that fetches the latest changes from the remote
repository and merges them into your current branch.
It essentially combines git fetch and git merge into a single
command.

### Fetching:

git fetch: is a command that retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into your current branch.
This allows you to review the changes before deciding whether to merge them.
